# Endometriosis Ireland

My website's main objective is to raise awareness about Endometriosis, a condition that affects approximately 6 million women. I provide basic information about the symptoms, diagnoses, and recent research on Endometriosis. Additionally, I aim to create a sense of community by sharing links to forums where people can share their experiences and support one another.

The site is live, the link is <a href="https://nathan-cool.github.io/Endometriosis_Ireland/" target="_blank">HERE</a>

# Technologies Used

# Testing:
## Device Tesing
At the beginning of the project, a mobile-first design was implemented and adjustments were made to ensure it looked good on all screen sizes. The following devices were tested:

- iPhone X
- iPhone 14
- 24" computer screen (1920 by 1080)

## HTML-W3C-Validator 

## CSS-Validator  

## Lighthouse testing

## Browser Testing

## Fixed Bugs

## Implementation:
During development, the developer tools in Google Chrome were used primarily for testing devices. The selector tool was used to select certain elements on the page, and this was done on each device by selecting the said device on developer tools. Design changes were implemented from the developer tools to see what the design or design change would look like. This greatly helped in the speed the ideas could be implemented. The website was tested on each device by opening the index.html in the live server, a plugin on Visual Studio Code. From there, developer tools were opened, and elements were first checked to make sure they were working as expected. Then, the code on developer tools was checked if the element worked as expected. If the element worked as expected, the next element was tested. The dimensions: responsive were also used to check the responsiveness of the website.

 

# Deployment
To deploy this website, I utilized Visual Studio Code and Git. I deployed the website to GitHub and then hosted it on GitHub Pages. This allows for easy accessibility, as the website can be viewed without the need to fork the repository. A step-by-step can be found below on how to deploy to GitHub page

Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
